# Data-Structures-Project1

The purpose of this project is to implement the use of Object-Oriented Programming Principles and
Polymorphism in Java. A simple class hierarchy is created and tested with a test program.

The description of the problem is as follows:
Design a class name Person and its two subclasses, Student and Employee. Make Faculty and Staff subclasses of Employee. 
• A Person has a name, address, phone number, and an e-mail address.
• A Student has a class status (non-matriculated, freshman, sophomore, junior, senior),
  which are defined as constants with 0 being non-matriculated, 1 being a freshman, 2 being a
  sophomore, 3 being a junior, and 4 being a senior.
• Employee has an office, salary.
• A Faculty member has office hours and rank.
• A Staff member has a title.

Full use of inheritance and use of class hierarchy is required. For example, since Student is a subclass of Person, 
Student shall also have all attributes of a Person, however these attributes must be inherited from Person, 
along with any methods to work with these attributes.

Override the toString() method is required for every class you define. The toString() method will produce a string that
will display the values of all attributes in a neatly organized form.
